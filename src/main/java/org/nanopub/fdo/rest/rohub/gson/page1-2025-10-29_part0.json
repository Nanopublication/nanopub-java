      "title": "Facing heat extremes: lessons learned from 15 years of climate change adaptation in Portugal",
      "description": "Presentation at the CE3C Annual Meeting, Azores - Portugal\n\n*10-12 October 2025*\n\nThe first Portuguese National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change was adopted in 2010, aiming to adjust climate and other sectoral policies, and to increase the countries’ resilience to observed and projected climate change impacts. Since then, many resources (e.g. policy documents, scientific articles, data sets) relevant for national adaptation have been published, yet often remain unknown to, or inaccessible, for the multiple stakeholders that comprise the climate adaptation community (CCA) in Portugal. The application of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability) principles to these resources has the potential to improve their discoverability, accessibility, and usability and ultimately promote a more effective climate adaptation planning in Portugal. \n\nThis study explores the state of the art of scientific research on climate change adaptation in Portugal since 2010, to assess strengths and limitations of knowledge, identifying key priority areas for future research and the “FAIRification” of these resources. As the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events in Portugal increases, this study focused on heat-related hazards, and associated impacts. A systematic search was performed across Scopus and ISI Web of Science to identify relevant peer-reviewed articles between January 2010 and May 2025. The resulting publications were analysed by geographical scope, adaptation sectorial focus, knowledge sector, climate hazard and CCA needs. Alignment of the current scientific outputs with FAIR principles was also analysed. \n\nA total of 217 articles were reviewed. Research was mostly performed at the city or national level (37% each) and the majority of adaptation actions were done under the agricultural or urban sectors (19% and 26%, respectively). Research was multidisciplinary, covering different knowledge sectors, from health impacts to biodiversity, buildings and construction, and often included several knowledge sectors in the same article. All articles presented accessible metadata but only one made its scripts and data available for further replication.  \n\nResults show that scientific research on heat-related climate change adaptation in Portugal is diverse and covers many knowledge areas, but the availability of its data needs improvement. Further work will include policy FAIR assessment of policy documents and datasets. This work was developed under the Horizon Europe project FAIR2ADAPT.",

      "title": "Supporting data for \"Using synthetic RNA to benchmark poly(A) length inference from direct RNA sequencing.\"",
      "description": "Polyadenylation is a dynamic process which is important in cellular physiology. Oxford Nanopore Technologies direct RNA-sequencing provides a strategy for sequencing the full-length RNA molecule and analysis of the transcriptome and epi-transcriptome. There are currently several tools available for poly(A) tail-length estimation, including well-established tools such as tailfindr and nanopolish, as well as two more recent deep learning models: Dorado and BoostNano. However, there has been limited benchmarking of the accuracy of these tools against gold-standard datasets. In this paper we evaluate four poly(A) estimation tools using synthetic RNA standards (Sequins), which have known poly(A) tail-lengths and provide a valuable approach to measuring the accuracy of poly(A) tail-length estimation. All four tools generate mean tail-length estimates which lie within 12% of the correct value. Overall, Dorado is recommended as the preferred approach due to its relatively fast run times, low coefficient of variation and ease of use with integration with base-calling.",

For a diagnosis, the symptoms have to be present for more than six months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, work, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. Additionally, it is associated with other mental disorders and substance use disorders. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many people with ADHD have sustained attention for tasks they find interesting or rewarding, known as hyperfocus.",

In line with ECCA’s theme ‘Managing cities to be fit for the future’, the main goal of this session is to demonstrate how an ecosystem of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) technologies and services can support CCA stakeholders (e.g., researchers and practitioners) in their decision-making processes. The panel presentations will feature concrete examples of how FAIR tools and approaches can help CCA researchers and practitioners overcome barriers to accessing, using, and reproducing data and generating interoperable services. In addition, this session aims to gather information on the breadth of knowledge CCA stakeholders work with and how this knowledge is produced, providing key insights for FAIR experts who need a clear understanding of user requirements to design effective FAIR tooling.",

      "description": "# Improving data availability for climate risk assessments under the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities\n\n## Vision & Ambitions\nIn this case study, we want to:\n\n1) Provide insights into data used and needed by businesses and consultants to perform climate risk assessments for reporting under the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities; \n\n2) Collect local climate hazard data that is being used in such analyses; \n\n3) improve accessibility to key datasets for climate risk analyses under the EU taxonomy.\n\n## Description \nClimate risk analyses under the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities (Pan-European)\n\nMore and more companies in the EU are required to report on how their economic activities are contributing to the six environmental objectives of the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities. In this context, the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 requires companies to perform climate risk assessment for two possible purposes: to show that an economic activity is contributing to climate change adaptation (environmental objective #2) or to check whether an activity that contributes to another objective will do so even under a changing climate (do-no-significant-harm check). The regulation has detailed requirements that a climate risk analysis needs to fulfil, e.g. climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale and at least 28 different climate hazards need to be considered. Experience shows that business as well as consultants are struggling with the very demanding requirements and the very parcelled climate hazard data landscape.\n\nWhile there is a lot of data available on the 28 climate-related hazards that businesses need to analyse, data is not tagged / structured in a way that users can easily find it. Many businesses have operations across different EU countries which makes it even more challenging to conduct a harmonised assessment for all relevant locations and at the most appropriate local scale. Furthermore, many businesses will be required to prepare an adaptation plan that includes adaptation measures and is in line with local, regional and national adaptation strategies.\n\n## FAIR2Adapt Contribution\nBy accompanying two businesses in preparing climate risk assessments as part of their EU taxonomy reporting, will provide an overview on the sources that are being used for the assessments, from local to national to European sources. Furthermore, we shall document important data gaps and highlight possible difficulties when combining the different datasets during the assessments, e.g. problems because of different temporal or spatial scales. Guided by approaches from WP 3 to 5, strategies to make the most valuable data FAIR, using a vocabulary that is consistent with the requirements in the EU taxonomy, will be developed.\n\n## Lead Partner\nADELPHI\n\n## External Stakeholders involved in CCA\nTwo businesses that have operations in multiple EU countries, and have to report under the EU taxonomy.",

Citizens and local administrations will be targeted in order to raise their awareness about the ML issue and importance of prevention to avoid environmental damage and societal costs. This will be done with specific dissemination campaigns, including participatory and large scale clean up aimed at identifying and tracking ML with MAELSTROM app for an efficient disposal and treatment. The engagement requires people to think about plastic trash, citizen responsibility and circular economy potential. All these actions are expected to change the way they perceive ML, and\nhow themselves can be part of change and make a difference.",

      "description": "The objective is supporting the Circular Economy Strategy, the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy aiming at having all typologies of ML and plastics removed identified, sorted and reused. MAELSTROM will combine innovative processes to recover valuable material for a new life cycle, demonstrating that a sustainable plastics economy can be possible from marine litter and providing a strategic circular marine litter vision for the future. This will be pursued by involving diversified players in the plastic value chain and deploying a mix of ML treating technologies made of physical, chemical solutions. The conversion of solid waste feedstocks into chemical precursors, polymers, materials, etc. shall foster an ecosystem-based bio-industry, innovative manufacturing processes in line with the circular economy approach. The pyrolysis waste-to-energy plant will also produce primary power and 2nd generation fuel. This fuel will be utilized to co-supply MAELSTROM raft energy demands for the removal of seabed/water column ML. The set of ML derived products will be thoroughly analysed for new market prospects within a new industrial life cycle.",

      "description": "# Towards the FAIRification of a city-level Climate Adaptation Strategy \n\n## Vision & Ambitions\nThis case study seeks to: \n\n1. Enhance the accessibility, usability and clarity of a climate adaptation strategy by applying FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles to both the policy document itself and its underlying climate risk and adaptation data.\n2. Support effective science-policy communication by ensuring that climate risk and adaptation         information is structured, documented, and presented in a way that is understandable and actionable for policymakers and stakeholders.\n3. Point out gaps and improve FAIRness for key datasets by engaging with data providers and data users.\n\n## Description \nClimate adaptation strategies are essential for guiding responses to climate-related risks at local and regional levels. These strategies often serve as reference documents for policymakers, practitioners, and other stakeholders involved in planning and implementing adaptation measures. However, such documents and datasets are often difficult to locate, interpret, or reuse due to inconsistent formats, insufficient metadata, or unclear communication. The project addresses these challenges and aims to make such documents more accessible by applying FAIR principles to a selected climate adaptation strategy and its associated climate risk and adaptation data, as well as by enhancing data-policy communication and, in this context, the updating process of adaptation strategies. Understanding the needs of city council staff, policymakers, stakeholders, and data users will also be a key focus, to ensure that the data and information provided by the strategy can be effectively integrated into their work.\n\n## FAIR2Adapt Contribution\nFair2Adapt supports the FAIRification of climate adaptation strategies and related data by reviewing existing materials, engaging with stakeholders, and promoting FAIR best practices for data management and enhanced science-policy communication. The project aims to improve the accessibility and usability of adaptation information for policy and decision-making.\n\n- Reviewing and enhancing climate risk and adaptation strategy documents to ensure alignment with FAIR standards.\n- Enriching the policy document with machine-readable metadata and standardized vocabularies to improve discoverability and integration with other data sources.\n- Producing communication approaches that translate complex datasets into actionable, policy-relevant insights based on FAIR criteria.\n\n\n## Lead Partner\nadelphi\n\n## External Stakeholders involved in CCA\nDecision- and policy-makers, knowledge producers (e.g., climate data providers), knowledge brokers (e.g., consultancies), city councils, and other user groups",

Ensure that climate adaptation knowledge is accessible within EOSC, increasing its usability for a broad range of stakeholders.\n\n### Description\n\n\nUsers cannot quickly and easily find information, which impedes communication, coordination and collaboration. Knowledge is increasingly online, but fragmented, unstructured and siloed so users find it hard to search and discover information that they may not know exists. \n\nweADAPT is a global online knowledge-sharing platform designed to improve access to climate adaptation information, widely used amongst researchers, practitioners and decision-makers. Knowledge on the platform is organized around +25 themes and networks, and the platform also uses keywords to enhance discoverability.\n\nThis project aims to make climate adaptation knowledge more accessible, discoverable, and usable by developing improved taxonomies and knowledge graphs. We hope it will also improve communication and collaboration between different stakeholders.\n\nThe project will involve extracting, curating and making climate and non-climate information available.

      "description": "# City of Hamburg \n\n### Climate-induced stressors and their effects on urban societies\n\n## Vision & Ambitions\nThe purpose of this case study is to:\n\n1) Examine climate-induced stressors and their effects on urban societies; \n\n2) Integrate socio-economic data on vulnerability and exposure of urban population with physical climate hazard data to explore future climate risks of the city of Hamburg and to inform sustainable climate change adaptation strategies.\n\n## Description\n\n### Urban climate risk assessments (Hamburg, Germany)\n\nHamburg, a city with various climate-related risks, needs to adapt to climate change in a systematic, sustainable and cross-sectoral approach. At the organisational level, the interaction between administration and public companies is crucial for implementing adaptation strategies and consideration of the interactions between the various actors and sectors of the urban system, which is a prerequisite for sustainable adaptation planning. In addition, adaptation and mitigation must be weighed against each other to assess trade-offs and avoid incompatibilities (e.g., urban densification versus adaptation to climate-induced stressors), requiring tailored state-of-the-art climate and adaptation scenarios (e.g., Representative Concentration Pathways RCPs and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSPs).\n\nAdaptation at the city scale requires very fine-scaled (high-resolution) data. Granulated data on exposure and vulnerability of urban sectors, infrastructure and population as well as data on climate-induced stressors is managed by different city authorities under the Hamburg City Senate, and not always publicly available. Understanding climate risks and barriers to adaptation at urban scale requires a concerted effort across city authorities for data curation and sharing. Data related to climate-induced stressors are often not updated or do not utilise European or global data portals (e.g. Copernicus). So far 572 datasets (e.g., on green spaces, city trees, population data, infrastructure data, building characteristics, soil properties, noise levels, air pollution, weather station data) from different sources or authorities is gathered in a data portal (Geoportal Hamburg), containing metadata and maps in pdf format. Hamburg’s adaptation portals are referenced in Climate-ADAPT but only in terms of qualitative information.\n\n## FAIR2Adapt Contribution\nFAIRification of available data to enable a more transparent, user-friendly and up-to-date data portal for adaptation decision-making. Provenance information and semantic crosswalks between climate and cross-sectoral data will help in the integration of data.\n\n## Lead Partner\nUHAM\n\n## External Stakeholders involved in CCA\nFree and Hanseatic City of Hamburg Senate Chancellery",

At present, data from NorESM is \"dumped\" from the High-Performance Computing (HPC) to the NIRD archive with minimal metadata, which makes it difficult for non-expert users to understand and reuse the data for CCA. This challenge is further complicated by the large size of data sets and their preservation in a format unfamiliar to most users.\n\n## FAIR2Adapt Contribution\n\nA Framework for FAIRifying climate models e.g. input and generated output data, as well as the model itself (model metadata), for assisting end-users in the definition of sustainable CCA scenarios.\n\n## Lead Partner\n\nNERSC\n\n## External Stakeholders involved in CCA\n\nArctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP)",

      "title": "Volcanic and Seismic source Modelling (VSM). The Python toolkit for modelling geodetic data",
      "description": "Volcanic and Seismic source Modelling (VSM) is an open source Python tool to model ground deformation detected by satellite and terrestrial geodetic techniques. The VSM tool allows the user to choose one or more geometrical sources as forward model among sphere, spheroid, ellipsoid, fault, and sill. It supports multiple datasets from most satellite and terrestrial geodetic techniques: interferometric SAR, GNSS, levelling, Electro-optical Distance Measuring, tiltmeters and strainmeters. Two sampling algorithms are available, one is a global optimization algorithm based on the Voronoi cells and the second follows a probabilistic approach to parameters estimation based on the Bayes theorem. VSM can be executed as Python script, in Jupyter Notebook environments or by its Graphical User Interface.\nVersion 1.0 April 2022.\nFor any inquires, please write to elisa.trasatti@ingv.it",

      "title": "FAIR2Adapt project (2025 - 2027)",
      "description": "## Objective\n\nThe FAIR2Adapt is a multidisciplinary project geared towards transforming data into actionable knowledge to shape climate adaptation strategies. By leveraging and collaborating with EOSC, we fully tap into the EOSC's wide range of services, the FAIR Implementation Framework Catalogue of Resources, and align with the EOSC interoperability framework. We adopt FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs) by using RO-Crate and nanopublications as key implementation tools. We use semantic bridging strategies, such as the I-ADOPT framework, and tailored FDO services to build a collaborative, user-friendly FAIR and open data sharing framework. Rich case studies will co-develop FAIR Supporting Resources in alignment with the FAIRification framework and demonstrate the impact of FAIR and open data sharing on climate change adaptation, and strategically support the EU Mission’s objective of enhancing climate resilience in European regions and communities. Through transfer cases and collaboration with other initiatives, FAIR2Adapt extends its reach to additional contexts, showcasing its scalability, sustainability and applicability beyond the project’s completion. A significant aspect of the FAIR2Adapt project is stakeholder engagement and capacity-building activities, which will be instrumental in raising awareness and devising customised solutions. By transforming data into flexible, practical, and resilient climate adaptation strategies, FAIR2Adapt constructs a scalable and extensible model for data sharing that can be adapted to multiple climate adaptation scenarios. The impact of FAIR2Adapt will span across scientific advancement, economic resilience, social-environmental wellbeing, and responsive policy development, fostering multidisciplinary cooperation, enhancing trust in science, and stimulating a climate-smart economy. Ultimately, FAIR2Adapt intends to build a more resilient, inclusive and knowledge-based society capable of efficiently tackling the challenges of climate change.",
