Welcome to nanopub-javaâ€™s documentation!

The `nanopub-java` library is Java-based library for nanopublications (see http://nanopub.net) based on RDF4J.

Nanopublications are a formalized and machine-readable way of communicating the smallest possible units of publishable information. See the [What are Nanopublications?](getting-started/what-are-nanopubs) page for more information.
